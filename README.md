# Chronic Kidney Disease Classification
Initially there are no specific symptoms, but kidney function can slowly decline. A stage can come when kidney can no longer keep up with removing waste products and extra water. This is called kidney failure. Although there is no cure, treatment options are available.

There can be lots of reasons for this, eg, the person is not getting frequent checkups due to lack of awareness or the people are not having quick and low-cost access to modern digital solution.
